Greetings, Summoners,

Welcome to patch 8.5, the one that's the "small patch" to 8.4's "big patch". This patch is actually a large download, because we're updating some of our in-game assets.

But back to gameplay! This patch we're taking a look at professional outliers, some of whom have been problem children for awhile now (Azir, Galio, Ryze). We're also revisiting Zoe after heavy nerfs last patch, giving her power back in places we think should be healthier in the long run.

Then, we've given a couple of juggernauts (Skarner/Volibear) more utility since preseason, but those changes have left them overly dominant. We're dialing back to a middle ground in between their old state and their current state.

Finally, League of Legends newest marksman, Kai'Sa, is setting foot on the Rift. Bring an umbrella: the forecast calls for Icathian Rain.

GHLF,
