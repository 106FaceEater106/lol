Sup homies,

Welcome to patch 7.15, the one where we dial back on the Cho’Gath update and tone down some of the dominant competitive picks in the game.

For the competitive side of the game, Regional Finals are approaching. As a result, we’re trying to increase some variance at the highest levels of play, but also to create some stability, and that means many minor changes. To start, we’re giving some dominant champions love taps downwards, as well as showing some love to underplayed champions on the cusp of seeing professional play. So while it may look like a larger patch than usual, many of the changes are pretty small.

Oh, and remember Urgot? Well, we’ve pimped his ride and now he’s headed to the battlefield as a brand new juggernaut, complete with knee-shotguns. We’ll say that one more time for you. Knee-shotguns. Check ‘em out.

So get out there on the Rift and read up on Urgot’s abilities, or you’ll Dread Nought knowing what he does when he grinds you to pieces.
