[‚Å£](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lTtwYAlQN3k)Hey tacticians! Who's ready for some Teamfight Tactics?

Patch 9.13 marks the official launch of the long-awaited game mode and we will begin rolling-out to regions all over the world starting today. We'll be continuously updating and building it with you, so please let us know if you have any feedback and report bugs as you see them!

We're welcoming Qiyana to the Rift as well. The Empress of the Elements is sure to tickle the bones of those who love playing quick and high-damage assassins.

We also want to give a shout out to those who've been following the Life of a Patch campaign with the balance team! It was great pulling back the curtain on the champion balancing process and giving a more in depth runthrough of how and why we make the buffs and nerfs we do. Those who kept an eye on the Nexus hub with the live champion iterations won't be surprised at the changes to Illaoi, Pyke, and Udyr, and Sona nerfs (sob) listed below.

P.S. Grumps is the best Little Legend. You know which one we mean.
