Greetings, Summoners,

It's the first patch of the new season, and that means it's our last chance to make changes before the season starts! We already had an extra patch (7.24b) to round out the preseason leading into the holiday break, so this patch is a good deal smaller than usual.

The Ranked ladder resets with this patch, so weâ€™ll see you out there for placements. To go with that, there are a few updates to the Honor system aimed at rewarding honorable players with some sweet loot!

GLHF!
