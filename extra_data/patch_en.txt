Greetings, Summoners,

Welcome to patch 8.3, the one where Swain gets a shiny, updated kit. A few champions have been standing out not necessarily because they're the strongest champions, but because they're the most generalist, so we're sharpening their intended weaknesses to give opponents more deliberate counterplay.

Then there's our iconic basic attackers. Master Yi and Tryndamere have been having a rough year, so we're giving them a bit more damage to help them be more relevant. We donâ€™t intend to fix all of their problems this time around, just make them feel less weak.

Finally, we're gnawing at the outliers of mid and marksman rosters. There are a few top picks that outclass the others, and some old favorites who have fallen heavily out of favor.

So grab your Noxian demon arm, remember that the bird is the word, and get out on the Rift and crush your enemies.

GLHF,
