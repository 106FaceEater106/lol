Greetings, Summoners,

Welcome to patch 8.7, the one where we nerf Irelia. Sorry, I'm being told that's update Irelia. Everyone's favorite Blade Dancer is hitting the Rift with a new model and kit.

We're also following up on the Duskblade changes from last patch, visiting the assassins who were affected more—or less—than we'd expected.

Finally, we're hitting Ninja Tabi. Those boots had taken over as the dominant choice, and while that makes sense on tanks, it's a bit concerning when they're such a compelling purchase for marksmen as well.

So hop out on the Rift, and remember, GLHF,
