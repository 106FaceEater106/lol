Welcome to another patch, team.

If you've got the sneaking feeling that someone's behind you, you might not be crazy. Evelynn's update is here, bringing Agony's Embrace back in a brand new way. Should you find yourself on the wrong side of a Hate Spike or three, we've got you covered: the Emotes system launches globally this patch, offering new ways to let friends and foes alike know how you really feel.

Balance-wise, 7.20's on the lighter side of things, particularly compared to last patch. We're hard at work preparing the way for Runes Reforged, and given how much of a shakeup League's about to see, we're primarily reserving patch work for long-term wins like the Sterak's update below.

That'll do it for this patch! Best of luck on the Rift, particularly if you're sleep deprived from playing League and watching Worlds.
