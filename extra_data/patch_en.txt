Greetings, Summoners,

Welcome to 7.19, the one where Worlds patch is finally in the rearview mirror and we can introduce some of the bigger changes we’ve been working on. There’s a lot this time around, so let’s dive right in!

First, we’ve got Ardent Censer and Janna, both of which have been warping the bot game landscape for awhile. We’re looking to put a clearer strength profile on both of them, and - in Janna’s case - making sure she has more punishable weaknesses as a tradeoff for her late game strength.

We’re also taking this opportunity to give Azir an ability update at this point, trimming a lot of his extraneous strengths (range), but also upgrading his damage. With clearer weaknesses to exploit, we’ll be able to leave Azir in a healthier place than in previous patches.

Finally, Xin Zhao hasn’t been touched since we removed Devourer a year and a half ago. We’re looking into his kit to give him a clearer identity.

There's a lot of updated champions this patch, so brush up on the changes before you hop onto the Rift!
