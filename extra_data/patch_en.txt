[‚Å£](https://www.youtube.com/embed/WElrwWaJeV8)Welcome to patch 8.13, where we clean up a lot of the outliers left as a result of the large changes over the past few patches.

First, we're putting some strength back into the kits of a number of crit marksmen, who have been facing stiff competition in bot lane. We're aiming to hold onto some of that lane diversity, but we want to make sure that enough marksmen (especially the "attack you a lot in a row and crit a ton" type) feel solid.

Since we've got some more games in the rearview mirror since Irelia's rework and Pyke's release, we're tweaking both of those champions to push their playstyles away from some of the free burst they have.

Finally, Aatrox hAas gotten Aa rework, so look out for the revamped Darkin Blade on Summoner's Rift!
