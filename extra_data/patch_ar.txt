Greetings, Summoners,

Welcome to patch 7.21, the last one before preseason starts in earnest. We’ve got a lot a big changes coming down the pipeline that will shake up the game, so this patch is a bit on the smaller side. That being said, we’re hitting a few outliers and looking to make playstyle changes to a few champions.

A few tanks - Galio, Sejuani, and Rammus - are sitting at far too much baseline effectiveness. We’re bringing that down, and in Galio’s case, giving him a bit more scaling to play with. We’re also taking a look at two juggernauts - Udyr and Urgot - and looking to give them a more reliable late game. Finally, we’re tweaking some items that have either dominated the landscape (hey there, Ardent Censer) or been underwhelming for awhile.

Next patch brings Runes Reforged, and with it will come a ton of change, but for now get out there and enjoy the last patch of Season 7!

Cheers,
