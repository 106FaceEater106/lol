Aloha, friends.

Welcome to patch 7.13, the one where Honor makes a comeback! At the end of every game you’ll be able to honor one of your teammates with one of the new categories. GG? GG! <3

We also have the regular balance changes; toning down Galio a bit, giving Gnar some love, reining in a certain electric rat, and sharpening the edges on both Kindred and Rek’Sai.

Closing it up, did you know we have new tips for the loading screen? We've also got a way to track your vision score during the game, and the SKT T1 skins are here!

See you on the Rift.
