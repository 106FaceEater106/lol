Waddup champs,

Preseason is at full steam! After shipping the most urgent balance changes in a mid-patch update shortly after Runes Reforged launched, we've got a few (not-quite-as) urgent ones here in 7.23. From here on, we'll start getting back to our normal balance work (read: not just focusing on raw power with base stat changes). We discussed our preseason Runes balance philosophy on our boards, so if this intro wasn't enough, go read that instead! We're being super careful in this time of experimentation, and couldn’t be more excited to see what's coming out of all the theorycrafting.

Past the balance side of things, we've adjusted post-30 EXP curves and the First Win of the Day mission reward based on your feedback. Hearing your thoughts is incredibly important to us, so please keep them coming! We're also knocking out a few longstanding feature requests: The Skins Tab, the ability to spectate Challengers, and about a year's worth of updates to the Game Info site all land this patch!

We'd of course be remiss to go without mentioning League's newest trickster. 7.23 brings Zoe to the Rift, and thinking with portals will totally be a thing! Exercise caution—when Zoe's in play, things are not going to go the way you think.

GLHF,
