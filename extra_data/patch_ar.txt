Welcome to a new patch, team!

Continuing recent trends, 7.17’s light on the balance front, but you’d be hard-pressed to call this patch “small” considering everything else going on! Ornn’s emerging from centuries of solitude (sort of… he is a toplaner, after all), and five new Star Guardians hit the Rift Valoran Park. Not sure where Valoran Park is? Sit tight for Invasion, League’s latest game mode. This patch also brings a sweet improvement to item sets—you can finally pre-select which slots your items go in when you pick ‘em up!

Quick housekeeping note: 7.17’s gonna be a longer patch than usual, so tack some extra days onto your expectations around the usual “during this patch”-esque comments below. The next set of notes will be for the patch we plan to host Worlds on.

Best of luck in your matches, friends.
