Waddup fam,

Midseason is coming up soon and balance will be a bit wobbly for a patch, so consider this patch more of a setup. That being said, we’re focusing on changes that either need to happen now, or will have evergreen results going forwards.

First, we’re taking this chance to look at the way latency interacts with gameplay. Obviously, nobody likes playing on high latency, but some champions suffer far more from the impact. We’re putting in some Quality of Life changes to make those champions less punishing when your inputs aren’t quite as responsive.

Then, there’s the pro scene. With MSI coming up, there are a few strong outliers we’d like to make sure aren’t completely dominating pick/ban phase, so we’re making appropriate changes as needed.

On the other end of the spectrum, now is the perfect time to show love to some underpowered champions who need playstyle love. Aatrox is getting some extra power in the aftermath of his update, while Udyr is getting a tiny update of his own.

Finally, we’re taking this chance to retune some of the game systems in Twisted Treeline and ARAM to give some of our quicker game modes a cleaner experience.

So get out there and toss some Poros.
