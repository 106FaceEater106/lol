Greetings, Summoners,

It’s time for patch 7.11, so wave your hands side to side and clap like you don’t care.

We’ve been taking on bigger-ticket champion changes more often, and this patch continues the trend. So, when appropriate, we’ll be separating larger projects out from the rest. This patch, that’s updates to Rek’Sai, Kindred, and Malzahar!

We’re also continuing to follow up on midseason. A few tanks are struggling without Sunfire Cape’s old combat damage, so we’ve got a few buffs to help them out. Maokai and Zac still aren’t quite hitting the gameplay patterns we’d like, se we’ve making a few more tweaks this patch.

Past the gameplay front, this patch also brings a few long-awaited features. A new 10-ban draft format will be rolling out to normal and ranked matches over the course of the patch, and item sets make their debut in the updated client!

Get out there and play some League, friends.
