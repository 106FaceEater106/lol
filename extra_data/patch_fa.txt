[⁣](https://www.youtube.com/embed/gj40w6uVTSM)8.18 brings us the first wave of changes focused on the World Championship later this year. In some cases, this means reining in outliers who are dominating pick-ban (as well as champs likely to take over

once those outliers are addressed). Other times, it means buffing champs who are on the cusp of consideration—picks we nerfed earlier in the season, in a few cases. 8.19 will contain another round of these changes.

Back to the here and now, the Nexus Blitz alpha ends with 8.18, but we aren't leaving you high and dry. Odyssey, our newest event, is here, so join the crew and smash some space nerds!
