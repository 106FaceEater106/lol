Welcome to a new patch, team!

Worlds is coming up, so none of these changes are particularly aggressive, but we do want to make sure that some of the dominant outliers get tapped down a bit, and some popular picks who have fallen out of favor see some love. Because the stability of this patch is so important, we’re holding back on deeper changes that we’re still investigating, but we’ll be revisiting those champions and items in future patches.

We’re also looking at Ornn. We micropatched Ornn twice last patch, and he’s still struggling. We don’t want to overbuff him, so are primarily focusing on his usability, but we’re still monitoring player performance as prospective Ornn mains progress up the mastery curve.

See you on the Rift,
