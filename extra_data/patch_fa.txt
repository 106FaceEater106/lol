Oh why, hello there!

Midseason has been here for a patch, which means it’s time to revisit the slate of changes and course-correct for any who aren’t hitting the mark. That means a few followup changes to the three tanks, additional usability for quests, and a tweak to Spirit Visage.

We’re also taking this time to hit some overperforming champions and bring them in line. Fizz and Lulu are no strangers to patch notes, and Ivern has been one of the top junglers for awhile now. Knocking them down a peg should leave other champions more room to shine.

Finally we’re delivering modernization improvements to a number of champions. The scale ranges from playstyle updates for Heimerdinger - yes, that Heimerdinger - and Rammus - yes, that Rammus - but also small quality of life tweaks (animations for Riven or Jax).

But wait, there’s more! If you enjoyed the ARAM changes from last time, we’re adding more on top of them to streamline the Howling Abyss experience.

Whether you’re dropping turrets with Heimerdinger or tremoring them down with Rammus, see you on the Rift, summoners!
