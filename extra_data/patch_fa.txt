Salutations!

Welcome to the patch 7.7 notes, the one where we’ve got changes to a lot of different stuff - forgotten supports and weak junglers for starters. Also, the header art’s different, so that’s neat. (We found a folder of cool pictures from seasons past, so we’re gonna start rotating through ‘em patch by patch!)

In terms of highlights, we've made chime collecting more rewarding for Bard and given Amumu better tools to help his teammates. Maybe now they’ll stick around after the match and be friends. We also have some quality of life buffs to some junglers that aren't so popular right now, such as Volibear and Jarvan IV. Plus, given the MSI hype engine is warming up, we’re taking another pass at the competitive scene (the faces will be pretty familiar).

In terms of a different kind of Highlight, the updated client’s got some improvements to the Highlights viewing experience (spoiler: you no longer have to root around in your file explorer). Those details, plus the rest of our client updates, can be found further down in the patch notes as usual.

That's it for this patch! Buckle up and dive into the buffet of changes below. See you on the Rift!
